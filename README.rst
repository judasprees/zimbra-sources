====================
Zimbra-Source Mirror
====================

**Please note**: As this `Forum post`_ suggests, it seems as if Zimbra is restructuring its code backend and enables a more 
friendlier, git-based frontent. So this repository will probably be deprecated and removed in the future.
 
This is an unofficial mirror of the VMware Zimbra Perforce Repository on GitHub.

As I find Perforce rather quirky and slow, I thought about mirroring the sources on the far more intuitive and lean GitHub.

Thanks to the guys at Zimbra and GitHub for letting me do this.

Please note the following:

**This repository is not connected to Zimbra or VMware in any way. Please don't ask for support about this repository. Don't send pull requests, because they won't be accepted anyway.**

**Additionally, please note all licenses in this repository. This really is only a mirror of the main repository.**
